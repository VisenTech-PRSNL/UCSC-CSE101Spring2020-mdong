This repo is for storing my assignment of CSE 101 Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms taught by Patrick Tantalo.
For all people other than myself should commit the code to a seperate directory under the main folder of each programming assignments. 

For students, you can contribute codes by pushing your codes inside of a directory named with a prefix of your school email. For example, "someone@someschool.edu-your_nickname_or_real_name" is acceptable as long as the nickname is not meant to be offensive to anyone. 

For general programmers, to contribute codes you also need a suffix "-external" after the name above. For example, "visentecho519@gmail.com-VisentTheWotageiGuy-external" fits with the format of "someone@someaddress.someorganization-your_nickname-external". 

Invalid commits will be removed.
